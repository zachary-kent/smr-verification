# Supplementary material for BigAtomics

This contains the supplementary material for BigAtomics. `smr-verification` contains the arifact for "Modular Verification of Safe Memory Reclamation in Concurrent Separation Logic", and the proof of BigAtomics is embedded in this artifact. The `CachedWaitFree` implementation is located in `theories/hazptr/code_cached_wf.v`, specification of a BigAtomic object is located at `theories/hazptr/spec_big_atomic.v`, and the proof that `CachedWaitFree` satisfies this spec is located at `theories/hazptr/proof_cached_wf.v`. A closed proof that the implementation satisfies the spec can be found at the end of `theories/hazptr/closed_proofs.v`

This artifact can be built by following the instructions in `smr-verification/README.md`. Note that, even while compiling in parallel, this will require a large amount of time. This is due to the automation within the the proof of `theories/hazptr/proof_cached_wf.v`. Thus, your terminal may appear to hang, but it will eventually terminate. We suggest using RocqIDE or VSRocq to step through the file, as they support asynchronous batch compilation and the file will compile much faster.
